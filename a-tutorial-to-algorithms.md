## A Tutorial To Algorithms (part 1) ##
### Introduction ###
These stuffs are not orgnized purpersely, nor it's a note of the book ***Introduction Algorithms***. Mostly it is like a sequence of my personal footprints when I learned Algorithm, which record my ideas, inspirations and deep thoughts.

That's a good learning method I think, also a good excersise for brain which would make the brain more sharp and effcient on normal problems of the computer world.
